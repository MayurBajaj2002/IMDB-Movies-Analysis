This is the third project as a part of my course on data analysis. Here, I carry out a more detailed analysis of a larger data set with multiple columns, including NaN values. I am going to wrangle, trim and clean the data to prepare it for analysis. Then, I shall pose some questions for investigation and carry out an analysis to report conclusions through a pdf document. This project makes extensive use of data visualistaions in order to reach conclusions. 
This project is a perfect example of how data analysts do their work in real life. At times, they face problems of much higher complexity than what I have faced in cleaning the data. 
Hope you like it
