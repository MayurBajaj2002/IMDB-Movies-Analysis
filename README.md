This is the third project of my course on data analysis. Here, I carry out a more detailed analysis of a larger data set with multiple columns, including NaN values. 

I am going to clean and wrangle the data to prepare it for analysis. Then, I shall pose some questions for investigation and carry out an analysis to report conclusions.
This project makes extensive use of data visualistaions. In fact, they are staple food for this project.

This time, we make use of SQL
